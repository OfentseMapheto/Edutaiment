In scene 1 the User will get a chance to interact with the content they are learning in this case we are using solar system , the user can interact with the planets by going to the planets while they learn about the planet, for each planet they approach the user will hear an audio of a teacher teaching the subject.

In scene 2 the user gets the fun facts about the planet of their choice. The aim here is to educate them about the planet whilst they wait to start the game.

Scene 3:

Link: 

https://hubs.mozilla.com/8McP9aC/glossy-incredible-commons

In this scene the user will find an austranaut with his/her spaceship. 
The Austranaut cannot leave because he/she needs to solve a problem to get the space ship to move so he can go back "home".
The user needs to "help the austranaut" in solving the problem.

2021 Scope expansion:

We expanded the scope of our project to tackle the tourism sector since it is currently the hardest hit industry by Covid-19. THis is also inline with an upcoming holiday in South Africa: namely, Heritage day. We came up with a concept that will teach people what makes us South Africans to be unique through this journey you will understand why we are different and ho are we similar as we use some of the well known South Affrican tribes.

Lessons learnt:
We managed to solve a couple of the issues we had initially faced like adding audio, pictures and video onto a room. We are still having issues with teleporting between scenees or rooms hence we chose to have everything on one scene to reduce the room for error/failure.
